# NOTE:
# - We intentionally do not enforce pydocstyle/docstring-convention rules via flake8
#   (many modules/classes/functions are intentionally light on docstrings, and enforcing
#   those rules would create high-churn edits without improving correctness).
# - Complexity is capped to catch extreme cases, but the current codebase contains
#   a handful of orchestration methods above 10.
